## Insights

Life science is transferring from experiment-driven to data-driven;

High-throughput multi-omics, including but not limited to genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and phenomics, technologies can generate comprehensive data of each individual or cell;

Large-scale population’s omics data can help us understand the world and ourself and is the fundamental to develop new drugs and therapy methods;

Genomics data is the most important and fundamental omics data;&#x20;

Decentralized technology stack, including but not limited to blockchain, Zero-knowledge proof, federal AI and decentralized storage solution, can ensure the ownership of individual's omics data and privacy, and unlock the power of population data.

## Challenges

* High cost to accumulate omics data and follow up:&#x20;
  * The cost of omics data generation is high, \~150USD for one 30x human wholegenome- sequencing&#x20;
  * The cost of phenotype collecting and follow-up in traditional cohort study is high, UK Biobank and AllofUs as example.&#x20;
  * People are not benefit from the rapid development of omics technologies and don’t have passionate to donate sample and data, and participate research projects.&#x20;
* Ownership and privacy protection:&#x20;
  * Accumulated omics data is invaluable for biomedical R\&D
  * Personal omics data is the most fundamental privacy for everyone and affect not only ourself, but also our family.&#x20;
* Regulation:&#x20;
  * Every government put tight regulations on omics, especially genomics data, to protect privacy and biosafety.
  * Omics R\&D and applications have to obey all these various regulation policies.

## Solutions

A Decentralized Storage and Analysis Network with Tokenomics is the unparalleled solution to unleash the full potential of Multi-Omics to enable groundbreaking advancements in biomedical research and application.

* Decentralized technologies to ensure ownership and protect privacy:&#x20;
  * Immutability of blockchain ensure everyone’s ownership of omics data.
  * Zero-knowledge proof to preserve individual‘s privacy during query and analysis
  * Federal query and machine learning for search and analysis
  * Decentralized omics data storage to meet the different regulation policies in different areas
* Utility token to purchase applications for individuals and collect data for R\&D purpose (see “[Tokenomics](tokenomics.md)” for details)

## Vision

Enabling groundbreaking advancements in biomedical research and development by harnessing the potential of a globally decentralized network of omics graphs.&#x20;

Our vision is to create a dynamic ecosystem that efficiently manages and leverages omics data and applications, fostering collaboration and innovation.&#x20;

Through this transformative approach, we aim to revolutionize the landscape of healthcare, ultimately contributing to a healthier and brighter future for all species, populations and every individuals, and the planet we are living.
