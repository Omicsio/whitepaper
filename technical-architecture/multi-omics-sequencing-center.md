Nowadays, multi-omics data generation relays on utlra through-put sequencers and other large biotech equipments. Omics will partner with existing multi-omics sequencing centers and build new multi-omics sequencing centers in selected areas.

Following are selected omics and corresponding technologies:

* Genomics & Transcriptomics: 
    * Short-read sequencers:
        * MGI: DNBSEQ-T7rs, DNBSEQ-T20x2
        * Illumina: Novaseq X plus
        * Ultima
        * Element
    * Long-read sequencers:
        * MGI: Cyclone
        * Nanopore
        * Pacbio
* Epigenomics:
    * Illumina 935K Epic V2.0
    * Illumina Novaseq X plus
* Proteomics:
    * Olink
    * SomaLogic
* Metabolomics
* Phenomics

Omics builder team are experienced on building and operating large-scale multi-omics sequencing centers.

Sequencer is becoming easy-to-use that can be installed in small clinics, and home, eventally. Omics will connect these equiments into its network directly.
